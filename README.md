# Homework_Pressure_Prediction


Task:
In the "data" folder there is folder for naca4_simple_multiple_airfoils. This folder contains the data set that is generated by running generate_data.py

NACA4_simple_multiple_airfoils
Your task is to be able to use machine learning (or any other creative method other than applying the direct equation of pressure as a function of the points) to predict
the pressure for each point that define the geometry. 

To keep things simple, Pressure = 2*y value of the point. 
Please split the data into a test set and train set. When completed please plot the results vs the x coordinate.

e.g.
plot(x,y_test)
plot(x,y_predicted)
